# Restaurant Management System Documentation

## Session Management

Sessions are displayed for each group currently dining in the restaurant. Each session includes details such as the table number, number of guests, service request status, number of bills open in the session, and tables assigned in the session. The session view displays a TagChip that shows if it is an active session. Only active sessions for the selected location are shown.

**Note:** A gold background indicates that a current Server Request is Present.

### Admin Capabilities

- **End Session**: Admin can close a session which will end the dining experience for that group. This action typically involves finalizing the bill and clearing the table for the next guests.
- **Add New Session**: Admin can initiate a new session for incoming guests. This involves assigning a table, recording the number of guests, and setting up any initial service requests.
- **Close Bill**: Admin can close individual bills within a session. This is useful when guests want to pay separately or when splitting the bill among multiple parties.
- **Create New Bill**: Admin can create additional bills within an existing session. This allows for flexibility in billing, accommodating requests for separate payments or itemized billing.

## Table Management

Tables are the seating arrangements within the restaurant. Each table has a unique identifier (table number) and can be assigned to different sessions based on guest arrivals. Tables are assigned a QR code that guests can scan to view the menu and place orders. The Table Management section shows if a table is active and if it is currently assigned to an active session, allowing for efficient table management. Tables can be added and removed from Groups as needed. Only tables for the selected location that are not part of a table group are displayed.

### Admin Capabilities

- **Add New Table**: Admin can add a new individual table in the "Add New" dropdown menu. This involves selecting a location for the new table as well as assigning it a table number, seat count and an optional QR code url.
- **Edit Table**: Admin can update the information related to an existing table. This includes changing the table number, seat count or QR code url.
- **Deactivate or Activate Table**: Admin can deactivate or activate an existing table. This action is typically taken when a table is temporarily unavailable for customer use. Only tables that are not linked to a session can be deactivated.
- **Delete Table**: Admin can remove a table from the system. This action is typically taken when a table is permanently removed from the restaurant's seating arrangement. Only tables that are not linked to a session can be deleted.

## Table Group Management

Table Groups allow Admin to manage larger parties by grouping multiple tables together. This is particularly useful for events or large gatherings where guests need to be seated together. The Table Group Management section provides an overview of all current table groups, including details such as the tables included in each group and the total number of guests. Only table groups for the selected location are displayed.

**Note**: QR codes do not have to be created for table groups. Orders are still associated with the group.

### Admin Capabilities

- **Add New Table Group**: Admin can create a new table group in the "Add New" dropdown menu. This involves selecting a location for the new table group as well as assigning it a unique name.

- **Deactivate or Activate Table Group**: Admin can deactivate or activate an existing table group. This action is typically taken when a table group is temporarily unavailable for customer use. Only table groups that are not linked to a session can be deactivated.
- **Add Table to Group**: Admin can select individual tables to add to a table group. Only tables that are not linked to a session can be added to a table group.
- **Remove Table from Group**: Admin can remove individual tables from a table group when they are no longer needed. This allows the tables to be used independently for smaller groups. Only tables that are in a table group that is not linked to a session can be removed from the table group.
- **Delete Table Group**: Admin can delete an existing table group when it is no longer needed. This action will ungroup the tables, making them available for individual seating. Only table groups that are not linked to a session can be deleted.
